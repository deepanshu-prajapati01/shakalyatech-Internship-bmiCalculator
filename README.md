# shakalyatech-Internship-bmiCalculator : An internship offered by [Shakalyatech](https://in.linkedin.com/company/shakalyatech) which helped me to develop skills by creating this single page web application with the help of React Js.

# Things i have learnt throughout the project:

* Enhanced Problem-Solving Skills
* Gained Hands-On Experience

# About this application:

* It is a basic web application having a navigation bar with 2 pages on 2 routes: `Home` and `BMI Calculator`
* Home page on `/` while the other on `/bmi`
* Home page having basic knowledge about bmi while the other page helps to calculate the BMI.

# Resources i used:

* I used [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for creative responsive layout which reduces lots of effort.
* For the logo of the webpage and other things, i used [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
